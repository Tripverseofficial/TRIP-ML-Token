# TRIP-ML-Token
Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to clone and set up the TRIP-ML-Token project:

Install Git: If you haven't already installed Git on your computer, go to the Git website and download the installer for your operating system.

Clone the repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tripverseofficial/TRIP-ML-Token.git
Install Brownie: The project is built using the Brownie framework, so you'll need to install Brownie to work with the project. To install Brownie, run the following command:


pip install eth-brownie
Set up the project: After installing Brownie, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:


cd TRIP-ML-Token
Next, you'll need to set up the project by running the following command:


brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.4.1
This will install the OpenZeppelin contract library, which is a dependency of the project.

Compile the smart contracts: After setting up the project, you can compile the smart contracts by running the following command:

brownie compile
This will compile the smart contracts and create the necessary artifact files in the build/contracts directory.

Run the tests: To make sure everything is working correctly, you can run the tests by running the following command:

brownie test
This will run the test suite and output the results to the terminal.

That's it! You've now successfully cloned and set up the TRIP-ML-Token project. From here, you can start working with the smart contracts and building out the project.





The Trip smart contract is an ERC20 token that utilizes time series forecasting, convolutional neural network (CNN), and sentiment analysis models to predict and perform the rebase function. The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation and AccessControl contracts. It also imports the Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface for accessing the price feed and SafeMath for safe mathematical operations.

The contract initializes with a few variables including the base price, last price, next rebase time, decimals, max supply, and a historical prices mapping. The contract owner can update the base price by calling the updateBasePrice function, which will generate a new base price using external time series forecasting services. The calculateRebaseInterval function uses historical price data to calculate the average daily volatility and adjust the rebase interval based on the volatility.

The contract emits a Rebase event whenever a rebase occurs, and the rebase function performs the following steps. First, it checks that the total supply of tokens is below the maximum supply and that the current time is after the next rebase time. Then, it loads the current market data and time series data using the loadMarketData and loadMarketAndTimeSeriesData functions, respectively. The market data is preprocessed for the CNN model, which generates a predicted price and volume using the preprocessCNNInputData function. The predicted price is used to adjust the base price, and the contract then performs the rebase operation using the _rebase function inherited from the ERC20 contract. Finally, the next rebase time is set based on the result of the calculateRebaseInterval function.
