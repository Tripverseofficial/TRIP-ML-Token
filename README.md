# TRIP-ML-Token
The Trip smart contract is an ERC20 token that utilizes time series forecasting, convolutional neural network (CNN), and sentiment analysis models to predict and perform the rebase function. The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation and AccessControl contracts. It also imports the Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface for accessing the price feed and SafeMath for safe mathematical operations.

The contract initializes with a few variables including the base price, last price, next rebase time, decimals, max supply, and a historical prices mapping. The contract owner can update the base price by calling the updateBasePrice function, which will generate a new base price using external time series forecasting services. The calculateRebaseInterval function uses historical price data to calculate the average daily volatility and adjust the rebase interval based on the volatility.

The contract emits a Rebase event whenever a rebase occurs, and the rebase function performs the following steps. First, it checks that the total supply of tokens is below the maximum supply and that the current time is after the next rebase time. Then, it loads the current market data and time series data using the loadMarketData and loadMarketAndTimeSeriesData functions, respectively. The market data is preprocessed for the CNN model, which generates a predicted price and volume using the preprocessCNNInputData function. The predicted price is used to adjust the base price, and the contract then performs the rebase operation using the _rebase function inherited from the ERC20 contract. Finally, the next rebase time is set based on the result of the calculateRebaseInterval function.
