# Script to ensure security best practices are followed

# Use a secure development process, such as the Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
# Conduct regular security audits
# Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to users or smart contracts
# Use the latest version of the Solidity programming language
# Use a testing framework, such as Brownie, to test the smart contract
# Use the latest version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
# Avoid using low-level functions such as call(), delegatecall(), and raw assembly code
# Use a multi-signature wallet for managing funds
# Use a time delay for withdrawing large amounts of funds
# Use a fail-safe mechanism for recovering lost private keys
# Implement access control to prevent unauthorized access to functions
# Implement input validation to prevent input data from being manipulated
# Use a secure method of storing sensitive data, such as encryption or hashing
# Implement error handling to prevent the smart contract from entering an invalid state
# Use gas limits to prevent out-of-gas errors
# Use a decentralized naming service, such as ENS, to avoid phishing attacks
# Keep the smart contract code simple and modular to reduce the attack surface
# Follow the OpenZeppelin library for implementing common smart contract functionalities
# Ensure the smart contract complies with local laws and regulations
